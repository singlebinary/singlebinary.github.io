  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>I am a research associate at the Pennsylvania State University and an active member of the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds (CEHW). My current research consists of two very distinct areas in Astronomy. These areas are interconnected through data analysis and statistical methods and yet each serves a different purpose. These areas are: (1) search for Earth-like planets around small stars; and (2) determine radii and masses of stars in binary systems.</p>

<p>Over the last decade the drive to find an Earth analogue has been one of the main objectives of NASA. With NASA&#39;s space-based telescope, Kepler, we are beginning to see this objective come to fruition. However, the challenges are aplenty and much work is needed to absolutely confirm the existence of an Earth-like planet outside our solar system.</p>

<p>The most common method of detecting a planet around a star is by looking at the motion of the star induced by an orbiting planet. As the motion of the planet is repetitive, so is the motion of the star. This repetitive stellar motion is called the wobble. A star with no planet has no wobble. Hence, by measuring the wobble of the star we can infer the presence of a companion while the amount of wobble tells us the mass of the companion.</p>

<p>The wobble of the star also depends on the size of the star and the planet. For example, Jupiter induces larger motion on the Sun than the Earth. Current technology limits the measurement of wobble induced by an Earth-like planet on a Sun-like star. However, looking for Earth-like planets around small stars mitigates this challenge. These small stars, also known as, M dwarfs are 70% smaller than the Sun. Hence, the effect of Earth-like planets on these stars are easily detectable.</p>

<p>My research at Penn State involves the design and observations of a large survey (~2000 stars). Through data analysis of thousands of spectra of these stars, I am able to characterize their physical property. The analysis helps to handpick stars that are most likely to have planets. Hence, increasing our chances to find Earth-like planet. For additional information please read my paper referred journal. I am also involved in the design of an upcoming larger survey (~10,000 stars). This survey will begin in Fall 2014 and go on for 5 years.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
