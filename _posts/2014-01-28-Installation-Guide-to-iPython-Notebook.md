The installation of ipython notebook on a mac may seem a little more tricky than on Windows or Linux. In the other OS, it is either double-click or use apt-get install. However, for the mac, a sequence of steps need to be followed. Here I highlight the steps that will help guide you install ipython notebook on a mac. 

You can also install iPython Notebook with macports

I assume that you have the latest version of Python installed.. Here are the steps to follow:
First install pyzmq. For all of the installations you will need root access. So, install the first package with pip in the following way: 

                         sudo pip install pyzmq

Next install Tornado. In my installation of python, this was already installed. Nonetheless, this steps ensures that you have a version installed. Tornado is required to support current version of browsers. 

                         pip install tornado 

Next install jinja2. Ninja is a template tool for rendering HTML pages. 

                          pip install jinja2

That’s it. Once this is done, you can test the iPython notebook installation with the following command in a terminal: 

                         ipython notebook 


This will open a new window or a tab in your browser. In my next post, I will add things you can do in a iPython notebook..
