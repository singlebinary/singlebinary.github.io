Today we had the opportunity to visit Penn State's President's office during the event, "President's Office Open House". The old main is the oldest building at Penn State, established during the founding of Penn State in 1855. The building currently houses the President's office and other administration offices. We also get to the famous bell tower. Below are the photos from this visit.

The above image shows Penn State's President's seal. This seal is hung in the President's large office. Interestingly, his table had two 18-inch screens. In this day and age, 18-inch monitors are quite small!

This is the most striking painting one sees when one enters the Old Main building. Everything around campus is gifted by the outgoing undergraduate students. The funding for this painting was given by the Class of 1923.
